# -IPL-Auction-Analytics-Optimizing-Player-Selection-with-Data
**Goal:** Develop an auction strategy for a new IPL franchise using past IPL data analysis (SQL). 

**Approach:** 

 1. Identify key player types: Aggressive Batsmen, Anchor Batsmen, etc.
 2. Define data-driven criteria for each player type (strike rate, average, economy, etc.).
 3. Analyze past IPL data to shortlist top player candidates for each category.
 4. Recommend a target number of players to acquire for each category (2-3 players). 

**Benefits:** 
Data-driven approach for informed player selection during the IPL auction. Build a well-balanced team with complementary skillsets. Increase chances of winning matches and building a strong IPL franchise. 

**Key Learnings:** 

 * Data-Driven Team Building: Analyzed player roles, performance metrics, and historical data to build a balanced and competitive squad.
 * Strategic Auction Techniques: Developed strategies for budget allocation, player prioritization, and RTM card usage.
 * SQL and Data Mastery: Gained expertise in writing complex SQL queries for data manipulation, aggregation, and insights generation.
 * Actionable Data Visualization: Learned to create impactful visualizations for clear communication of insights to stakeholders.
 * Player Evaluation and Ranking: Developed skills in player profiling, value assessment, and ranking for optimal team selection.
 * Team Dynamics and Strategy: Understood the importance of balanced team composition, adaptability, and considering factors like venue and pressure situations. 

 

**Key Insight** 

1. Player Selection Criteria:
    * Aggressive Batsmen: Players with high strike rates are crucial for scoring quick runs in T20 cricket. Examples include AD Russell, SP Narine, and HH Pandya with strike rates of 189.54, 171.27, and 167.06 respectively.
    * Anchor Batsmen: Consistency and stability are important, with players like HM Amla, ML Hayden, and KL Rahul having high batting averages.
    * Hard-Hitting Players: Prioritizing players based on the total number of boundary runs rather than boundary percentage to reflect their ability to make significant contributions. CH Gayle, SR Watson, and AB de Villiers are notable examples.
    * Bowlers with Good Economy and Strike Rate: Effective bowlers are those with a low economy rate and a good strike rate, such as M Prasidh Krishna and AD Russell.
    * All-Rounders: Players who contribute significantly in both batting and bowling, like AD Russell and SP Narine, are valuable assets.
    * Wicketkeepers: The selection is based on experience, batting strike rate, total runs scored, consistency, and proficiency in catches/stumpings. MS Dhoni and KD Karthik are highlighted as top candidates.
      
2. Data Analysis and Strategy:
    * Analyzing previous IPL data to build a balanced and strong squad. Using specific metrics like strike rate, batting average, boundary runs, and bowling economy to evaluate and prioritize players.
    * Fetching total runs scored for each venue to understand which venues are more favorable for scoring.
    * Year-wise analysis of runs scored at specific venues like Eden Gardens.
    * Analysis of the total number of boundaries and dot balls to understand batting and bowling performances. 

By focusing on these metrics and insights, the project aims to formulate a strategic approach to player selection and team composition, enhancing the chances of building a successful new IPL team
